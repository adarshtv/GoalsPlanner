This is my first blockchain web3 application. I'm using Angular for frontend. Nodejs for backend. Web3 package for interacting with blockchain. I am using Ganache as local blockchain for testing.

All the functions inside contract are working properly. I have tested them in Remix IDE with the help of Ganache. However some of the functions are not working when calling them via nodejs. Working on fixing them asap.
